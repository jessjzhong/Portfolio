                <p>More than half of users track their health and fitness in some sort of manner and majority want to have a simple and easy navigation. Through this survey, I was able to focus on the top 3 features to include in the mobile app. Therefore we need to include:</p>

                <li>Simple and easy UI for easy navigation and usability</li>
                <li>Third party app integrations for one central hub, increasing use of app</li>

            <p>Next, I conducted a competitive analysis by researching what’s currently out on the market and how a new player entering this space would need to differentiate itself amongst the plethora of health and fitness cloud apps. I wanted to identify what’s currently working and not working between, Google Fit, JEFit and DropBox. All three offer a space to house information but designed differently for their user’s needs and wants.</p>

            <h2>User Stories</h2>
            <p>Based on the information gathered from the user survey, competitive analysis and creation of user personas, I created
            user stories to help determine the tasks and needs of the users and prioritize the stories by the context of the
            product. After ranking each user story, this created the MVP (Minimum Viable Product).</p>

        <section class="usability-testing1">
            <h2>Usability Testing: Round 1</h2>>
                <p>For the first round of testing, I wanted to test users to validate my design decisions, by asking users to perform a few
                tasks.</p>
                <p>Task #1: Sign up and go through the onboarding process. I wanted to test how the user interacted with the design and if
                the onboarding experience was smooth.</p>
                <p>Task #2: Manually add an exercise. I wanted to find out if the add button was obvious and the process was simple and
                quick, thinking back to the problem.</p>
                <p>Task #3: Organize the dashboard. I wanted to test if it was intuitive to organize data into folders without clear
                instructions.</p>
                <p>Below is an example of the a design update based on the feedback I received for the first round of testing:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="usability1-photos">
                <img src="images/case-study/usability dashboard wireframe.png" alt="lofi dashboard">

                    <p>HiFi of Dashboard navigation bar has distinctive icons and more space between add button</p>

                </div>
                <p>In the lo-fi mockup, users were unsure which screen they were on when asked to go back to the main dashboard. Also,
                users mentioned the add button was too close to the navbar. Keeping that in mind, when crafting the first iteration of
                the high fidelity mockup, I made the following updated:</p>
                <ul class="usability-takeways">
                    <li>Softening and opaquing the other icons</li>
                    <li>Cleaning up and slightly moving the add button higher for more breathing room</li>

                <h2>Preference Testing</h2>
                    <p>After gathering some early feedback from the user testing on the wireframes. I began building off my wireframes and
                    weaving in the brand and visual design. There were some design decisions that highlighted different components of the
                    identity of the brand, therefore, several A/B testing was conducted.</p>
                    <p>As example below is which hero image the user preferred on the marketing landing page:</p>
                    <p>Which hero image do you prefer and why?</p>

                <img src="images/case-study/Desktop v2.png" alt="desktop version 2">
                    <p>77% users preferred this hero image because of its clarity, composition and activity.</p>

            <section class="testing round 2">
                <h2>Usability Testing: Round 2</h2>
                <p>I conducted three usability tests in-person for the second round to ensure the color choices and design elements
                reinforced the brand identity and the overall cohesion of the visual design and usability of the product. Using the
                feedback, I identified any common patterns and with those patterns, I applied those design changes as a continued
                iteration for a better user experience.</p>
                <p>Below are some iterations from the usability testing:</p>

                    <p>Visually, all users thought the graph on the left looked great but had a very difficult time understanding what kind of information the graph was trying to provide. Thus, I made multiple design changes to the graph:</p>
                <ul class="usability-takeways2">
                    <li>A small marker indicating the date</li>
                    <li>Subtle horizontal lines for better readability</li>
                    <li>Rings that represented the percentage of completion for each categories goals</li>

                <p>HealthPoint has joined a very competitive and growing space, and will need to continue with iterating and adjusting to
                the constant changes of user’s needs. I was very unsure how to differentiate ourselves from the rest of the apps but to
                my surprise, starting at the user survey results, not many apps do very well in all areas.</p>

                <p class="reflections-subheader">Lessons Learned</p>
                <p>Creating the HealthPoint app, taught me how usability testing and preference testing is essential to ensure certain
                design element or process can translate well with others. Being so close to the project for a few weeks can create
                tunnel vision. I learned that I need to let go a certain design element, such as a hero image, thinking it portrays the
                brand, but the preference testing proved otherwise. Learn to let it go and reiterate.</p>
                <p>This project also made me realize how much time I spend on creating wireframes and the high fidelity mockups. I think I
                spent too much being indecisive starting at the wireframes and knowing visual design is somewhere I lack, took quite
                some time to figure out how to utilize the color scheme and incorporate design elements. Going forward, I need to learn
                to quickly draft wireframes and make decisions, and understand making changes will happen during the design process.</p>

                and results, with empathizing and focusing on the user. Ultimately, our goal was to create an app that the user can
                utilize to improve their physical, mental and overall well-being.</p>
