            <div class="section1">
                <p><span class="emphasis">TL&DR: </span>I am a UX designer with a background in Human Resources that has a business acumen focused on
                people. My approach to design is storytelling for influence, that’s user focused through a combination of iterative
                research, meaningful conversations, and technology. I am committed to creating powerful people experiences by
                identifying the right problem to solve, with a deep understanding of the user and the goal to create better solutions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section2">
                <p class="aboutme-sub">BLAST FROM THE PAST</p>
                <p>My love for design has always been apparent, evidenced by my childhood affinity for drawing, water color paintings and puzzles.
                Despite this, my journey towards design has taken a particularly non-linear path. Like many kids back in the early
                2000s, I spent countless days creating web page layouts, banners, and vectors on Paint Shop Pro for various sites
                (Xanga; MySpace; one short-lived GeoCities page). However, this was seen as a hobby and my focus shifted toward
                obtaining a B.S degree in Management Science from UC San Diego.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section3">
                <p class="aboutme-sub">MY CURRENT LIFE</p>
                <p>As I reached my fifth year as a Human Resources (HR) Professional, my manager could tell I was not finding fulfillment
                in my job. She helped me to believe that I can be in career I actually enjoy. While I did not know what that was, she
                supported me in my search. From that point on, I embarked on my self-discovery.</p>
                <p class="sec3v2">I started, of course, by reflecting on what drew me to HR in the first place. How did I end up here? I saw it
                immediately: <span class="emphasize-about">People are complex.</span> One person may have a great employee experience, whereas another did not. Thinking
                about the entire employee life cycle, it starts from the first look at their resume, to their first day on the job, but
                it doesn’t just stop there. HR is the connection between the business and employees. We are the employee advocates,
                ensuring employees are continuously engaged, happy, and challenged. Rolling out employee programs and services from
                yearly wellness initiatives to creating an employee development series every other quarter is part of our job. Even
                better, it was an iterative process; each program and service was strategically curated for the employees from
                continuous feedback. Why did employees participate in this wellness initiative? Why did so few employees attend this
                development series? Did the employee have a smooth onboarding experience? I could see that this was the initial process
                that drew me in.</p>   
                <p>One day, I was asked to complete a series of usability tests, I was the power user of the HR Information System at my
                most recent company. As I participated in these tests, I was intrigued by how my interactions with the product would
                affect future iterations. I had to learn more. I began reading, learning, and building small projects. After much
                self-reflection and conversations with friends and persons within the industry; these conversations played an instrumental role in helping
                me realize my potential in being a part of a unique profession that combines my genuine curiosity of people, passion for
                creativity, and love for technology.</p>

            <div class="section4">
                <p class="aboutme-sub">TAKING THE PLUNGE</p>
                <p>To formalize my background and experiences, I decided to enroll into Bloc’s UX/UI program by taking the skills I’ve
                accumulated over the years and refine my design thinking into the digital design space. I firmly believe what I’ve
                gained in HR and my past love for creativity as a child, built a foundation in how I approach design. My approach in
                design is simple; talk and engage with people and gain a deep understanding of their story. <span class="emphasize-about">There’s a deeper meaning
                behind design, it’s the conversations and relationships you have with people by taking their story and weaving those
                stories into thoughtful solutions.</span></p>
