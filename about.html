<!-- About Me -->
<section class="essay">
        <h3>TL&DR</h3> 
        <p>Hello! I’m Jessica. I am a UX designer with a background in Human Resources that has a business acumen focused on
        people. My approach to design is storytelling for influence, that’s user focused through a combination of iterative
        research, meaningful conversations, and technology. I am committed to creating powerful people experiences by
        identifying the right problem to solve, with a deep understanding of the user and the goal to create better solutions.</p>
            <h3>BLAST FROM THE PAST</h3>
        <p>My love for design has always been apparent, evidenced by my childhood affinity for drawing, puzzles and athletics.
        Despite this, my journey towards design has taken a particularly non-linear path. Like many kids back in the early
        2000s, I spent countless days creating web page layouts, banners, and vectors on Paint Shop Pro for various sites
        (Xanga; MySpace; one short-lived GeoCities page). However, this was seen as a hobby and my focus shifted toward
        obtaining a B.S degree in Management Science from UC San Diego.</p>
            <h3>MY CURRENT LIFE</h3>
        <p>As I reached my fifth year as a Human Resources (HR) Professional, my manager could tell I was not finding fulfillment
        in my job. She helped me to believe that I can be in career I actually enjoy. While I did not know what that was, she
        desired to support me in my search. From that point on, I embarked on my self-discovery.</p>
        <p>I started, of course, by reflecting on what drew me to HR in the first place. How did I end up here? I saw it
        immediately: People are complex. One person may have a great employee experience, whereas another did not. Thinking
        about the entire employee life cycle, it starts from the first look at their resume, to their first day on the job, but
        it doesn’t just stop there. HR is the connection between the business and employees. We are the employee advocates,
        ensuring employees are continuously engaged, happy, and challenged. Rolling out employee programs and services from
        yearly wellness initiatives to creating an employee development series every other quarter is part of our job. Even
        better, it was an iterative process; each program and service was strategically curated for the employees from
        continuous feedback. Why did employees participate in this wellness initiative? Why did so few employees attend this
        development series? Did the employee have a smooth onboarding experience? I could see that this was the initial process
        that drew me in.</p>   
        <p>One day, I was asked to complete a series of usability tests, I was the power user of the HR Information System at my
        most recent company. As I participated in these tests, I was intrigued by how my interactions with the product would
        affect future iterations. I had to learn more. I began reading, learning, and building small projects. After much
        self-reflection and conversations with friends and persons within the industry, played an instrumental role in helping
        me realize my potential in being a part of a unique profession that combines my genuine curiosity of people, passion for
        creativity, and love for technology.</p>
            <h3>TAKING THE PLUNGE</h3>
        <p>To formalize my background and experiences, I decided to enroll into Bloc’s UX/UI program by taking the skills I’ve
        accumulated over the years and refine my design thinking into the digital design space. I firmly believe what I’ve
        gained in HR and my past love for creativity as a child, built a foundation in how I approach design. My approach in
        design is simple; talk and engage with people, truly understand and feel for their story. There’s a deeper meaning
        behind design, it’s the conversations and relationships you have with people by taking their story and weaving those
        stories into thoughtful solutions.</p>
        <p>When I am not behind my MacBook, you’ll find me climbing up or snowboarding down a mountain.</p>
